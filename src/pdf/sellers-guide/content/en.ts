    items: [
      {
        number: 1,
        title: 'Price It Right',
        description: `The most critical decision you'll make is your listing price. Price too high, and buyers will skip over your home. Price too low, and you leave money on the table. I'll provide a comprehensive market analysis comparing your home to recent sales, helping you find the sweet spot that attracts buyers while maximizing your return.`,
        tip: `The first two weeks on market are crucial. That's when your home gets the most attention from active buyers. Starting with the right price means capturing serious buyers when interest is highest.`,
      },
      {
        number: 2,
        title: 'Prepare Your Home',
        description: `First impressions are everything. Before listing, we'll identify improvements that offer the best return on investment. This might include decluttering, minor repairs, fresh paint, or professional staging. The goal is to help buyers envision themselves living in your home.`,
        tip: `You don't need to renovate your entire house. Focus on curb appeal, kitchen, and bathrooms. A deep clean, fresh landscaping, and neutral paint colors can transform how buyers perceive your home.`,
      },

        number: 3,
        title: 'Market Effectively',
        description: `Your home deserves maximum exposure to qualified buyers. I use professional photography, virtual tours, targeted digital marketing, and my network of agents and buyers to showcase your property. Every listing gets a customized marketing plan designed to reach the right audience.`,
        tip: `Professional photos are non-negotiable. Homes with professional photography sell 32% faster and for more money. Your listing photos are often the first impression buyers have of your home.`,
      },

        number: 4,
        title: 'Navigate Offers',
        description: `When offers come in, the work really begins. I'll help you evaluate each offer beyond just the price—considering financing terms, contingencies, closing timeline, and buyer qualifications. Together, we'll negotiate to get you the best possible terms.`,
        tip: `The highest offer isn't always the best offer. A strong buyer with solid financing and fewer contingencies often makes a smoother transaction than a higher offer with shaky financing.`,
      },
      {
        number: 5,
        title: 'Close Successfully',
        description: `Once you've accepted an offer, I'll coordinate inspections, appraisals, and all paperwork to ensure a smooth closing. I'll keep you informed every step of the way, addressing any issues before they become problems. On closing day, you'll sign documents, receive your proceeds, and hand over the keys.`,
        tip: `Keep receipts for any repairs or improvements made for the buyer. Have all warranties, manuals, and records organized for the new owners—it leaves a great impression and can prevent post-sale disputes.`,
